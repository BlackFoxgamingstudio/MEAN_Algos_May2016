#Strings (2nd set)
Continuing on with strings...

#####Notes on Strings...
  Strings are immutable.  Meaning, they cannot be changed in place like you would an array.
  For these algorithms, you will be creating new strings and returning them, unless asked for true/false or an array, of course.

##Censor
Create a function that, given a string and an array of 'naughty words', returns a new string with naughty words changed to 'x' characters.  Given ("Snap crackle pop nincompoop", ["crack", "poop"]), you should return "Snap xxxxxle pop nincomxxxx!".  

Advanced: Handle capitalization.  For example, given ("Snap crAckle pop nincomPoOp", ["crack", "poop"]), you should return "Snap xxxxxle pop nincomxxxx!".  You do NOT need to capitalize the corresponding 'x' characters.

##Bad Characters
Given two strings, the second string contains characters that must be removed from the first.  Return the resultant string.
